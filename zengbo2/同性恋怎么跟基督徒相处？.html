楼主可能没听过这首歌？

Take me to Church 描述的是基督教堂和同性恋之间的关系。
<br>
<br>
<p>
	<b>
		My lover's got humour
		<br>
		She's the giggle at a funeral
	</b>
</p>
<p>
	<b>
		（他其实是个男的）
		<br>
	</b>
	Knows everybody's disapproval
	<br>
	<b>
		I should've worshipped her sooner
	</b>
</p>
<p>
	<b>
		（暗示与其膜拜宗教，还不如膜拜自己的爱人）
		<br>
		If the Heavens ever did speak
		<br>
		She is the last true mouthpiece
		<br>
		Every Sunday's getting more bleak
	</b>
</p>
<p>
	<b>
		（对比宗教和爱情）
		<br>
	</b>
	A fresh poison each week
	<br>
	<b>
		'We were born sick, ' you heard them say it
	</b>
</p>
<p>
	<b>
		（因为同性恋被认为天生有罪）
		<br>
	</b>
	My church offers no absolutes
	<br>
	She tells me 'worship in the bedroom'
	<br>
	<b>
		The only heaven I'll be sent to
		<br>
		Is when I'm alone with you
	</b>
</p>
<p>
	<b>
		（对比所谓宗教的天堂和相爱的天堂）
		<br>
	</b>
	I was born sick, but I love it
	<br>
	Command me to be well
	<br>
	Amen. Amen. Amen
	<br>
</p>
<p>
	Take me to church
	<br>
	<b>
		I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
		<br>
		I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
		<br>
		Offer me that deathless death
		<br>
		Good God, let me give you my life
	</b>
	<br>
</p>
<p>
	<b>
		（直指宗教的虚伪，狭隘和不宽容；这句话重复了很多次，暗示自己愿意为了爱情献出生命）
	</b>
</p>
<p>
	<b>
		Take me to church

		<br>
		Good God, let me give you my life
	</b>
	<br>
</p>
<p>
	<b>
		If I'm a pagan of the good times
	</b>
</p>
<p>

	</b>
	My lover's the sunlight
	<br>
	To keep the Goddess on my side
	<br>
	She demands a sacrifice
	<br>
	To drain the whole sea
	<br>
	Get something shiny
	<br>
	Something meaty for the main course
	<br>
	That's a fine looking high horse
	<br>
	What you got in the stable?
	<br>
	We've a lot of starving faithful
	<br>
	That looks tasty
	<br>
	That looks plenty
	<br>
	This is hungry work
	<br>
</p>
<p>
	Take me to church
	<br>
	<b>
		I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
		<br>
		I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife

<p>
	Take me to church
	<br>
	I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
	<br>
	I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
	<br>
	Offer me that deathless death
	<br>
	Good God, let me give you my life
	<br>
</p>
<p>
	No masters or kings when the ritual begins
	<br>
	<b>
		There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
	</b>
</p>
<p>
	<b>
		（作者强调我们的罪，说的也是性取向，是何其无辜＝＝）
		<br>
	</b>
	In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
	<br>
	Only then I am human
	<br>
	Only then I am clean
	<br>
	Amen. Amen. Amen
	<br>
</p>
<p>
	Take me to church
	<br>
	I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
	<br>
	I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
	<br>
	Offer me that deathless death
	<br>
	Good God, let me give you my life
	<br>
</p>
<p>
	Take me to church
